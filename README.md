# Black or White (tãnãnãnã, tãã, nãã)

A proof of concept to choose programmatically the better color to stand into distinct colored boxes.
Yes, the project name is a tribute to Michael Jackson, Black or White music.

## How it works
For each color, they will calculate the distance between the color and black and white.
The further color will be choosed to colorize the icon inside the box.
